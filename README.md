# Deezer Fedora build script

Unofficial script to install Deezer desktop on Fedora (not finished yet!). Based on [the AUR Script by SibrenVasse](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/deezer/) and [siphomateke's fork](https://github.com/siphomateke/deezer).

For Windows, Deezer distributes a version of the Electron run time (Windows binary) and the source code of their application itself. The build process of this package extracts the application source from the Windows installer.
